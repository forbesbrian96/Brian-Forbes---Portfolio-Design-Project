# Brian-Forbes---Portfolio-Design-Project
General Assembly Project 1 - Designing a professional portfolio, with 3 unique points of interaction

https://lighthearted-dusk-a26859.netlify.app/ 

3 points of functionality: 
1) The nav bar opens multiple different divs, by changing the display of the selected div to "flex" on click, and setting the other divs to display "none". 
2) The "display themes" button on the nav bar opens up a drop down menu. This is was done using the toggle function, and applying it to the dropdown content inside of larger function, that could be triggered on click. 

The below link was quintessential in my understanding of how to create a dropdown. I did not just copy over the code, but I still want to point out that it is heavily similar, to avoid any accusation of plagiarism. The code in my site is a custom tailored version of this, to suit what I needed, with alterations that could not have been made if I didn't understand the material.

3) All of the themes in the dropdown are alternate color schemes, that when clicked, will be immediately implemented. I created functions that reassigned color values all over the page, and then triggered the function on click of the related button. This required a bit of hardcoding, but once one theme was finished, the block could be copy/pasted, and the color values reassigned, fairly quickly.

There are no special install instructions for this site.

FAILURES AND ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
1) I tried to create a custom tab, where the user could submit their own hex values to change the site. I've left my attempt in my code, but I didn't realize that this wouldn't really be possible without having a live server to hold the values submitted. This ended up growing beyond my current knowledge and abilities. 
2) The standard setting of the page has the nav buttons highlight a new color upon hover, which I could not replicate in the alternate color schemes. I got close in Night Mode, but while the text would highlight, the button itself wouldn't change colors.
